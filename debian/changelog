netcat-openbsd (1.89-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #145798)
  * Includes support for:
    - IPv6 (Closes: #461317)
    - Unix domain sockets (Closes: #348564)
    - SOCKS (Closes: #142898)
  * Conflict with netcat versions older than netcat-traditional, so that we
    can use alternatives.
  * Port some features over from netcat-traditional:
    - Exit successfully when printing help text (-h), and include the Debian
      revision.
    - Add the -q (quit on standard input EOF) flag.
    - Add support for specifying ports by name (/etc/services). Unlike the
      old hack for this, nc will first try to find a named service, then fall
      back to numeric parsing, so no escaping is needed.
